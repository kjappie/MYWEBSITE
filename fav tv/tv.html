            <p>
                Highly recommend this eeries to anyone and everyone! Such great characters and story telling.<br>
                I grew up with this series so it means a lot to me. The perfect series for all age groups, it
                never gets old!

            <img src="./tv-images/korra2.jpg" alt="The legend of Korra">
            <p>
                Much like Atla, Korra holds a dear place in my heart since Korra is somone I can relate to alot. This is
                a show I always come back to when I need some comfort! <br>
                A lot datker compareed to Avatar and a lot more action packed!
            </p>

        <li>
            <h2>Adventure Time</h2>
            <img src="./tv-images/adventure.jpg" alt="Adventure Time">
            <p>
                An extremely funny series. I think this is where I got most of my humour as a child... Unexpectedly dark
                at times too, such a well rounded show that explores more adult themes in later seasons
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>New Girl</h2>
